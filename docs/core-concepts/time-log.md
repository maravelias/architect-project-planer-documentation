# Time Log

---

## 1. Definition

A **Time Log** is a **record of actual time spent** performing work.

It captures effort **after the fact** for:

- transparency
- reflection
- analysis
- accountability

Time logs describe what happened.  
They do not determine what should happen.

---

## 2. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose of Time Logs"
    Time logs exist to:

    - understand where effort is being spent
    - support fee analysis and forecasting
    - provide evidence for billing or claims
    - improve future estimation accuracy

Time is a **measurement tool**, not a planning tool.

---

## 3. What a Time Log Is

!!! abstract "What a Time Log Is"
    A time log is:

    - a factual record of work performed
    - associated with a specific deliverable or task
    - attributed to an individual
    - bounded in duration

    **Typical entries include:**

    - 1.5h — Update Level 02 floor plan
    - 0.75h — Internal review of planning drawings
    - 2.0h — Client coordination call and notes

---

## 4. What a Time Log Is Not

!!! warning "A Time Log Is NOT:"
    - a task
    - a deliverable
    - a performance metric by itself
    - a justification for unnecessary work
    - a planning instruction

If time logs start driving decisions directly, the system is being misused.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Concepts

### Task
Time logs are **usually recorded against tasks**.

This allows:

- granular tracking
- minimal friction
- separation of effort from outcomes

---

### Deliverable
Time may also be logged **directly against a deliverable** when tasks are unnecessary or complete.

All logged time ultimately rolls up to a deliverable.

---

### Phase
Time can be summarized by phase for reporting and analysis.

Phases do not receive time logs directly.

---

### Project
All time logs exist within the context of a project.

Projects use time data for:

- insight
- reporting
- contractual support

Not for micro-management.

---

## 6. Granularity

Time logs should be:

- accurate to a reasonable increment (e.g. 0.25h)
- simple to enter
- descriptive enough to be understood later

Excessive precision reduces accuracy and trust.

---

## 7. Interpretation

Time data should be used to:

- compare estimated vs actual effort
- identify systemic inefficiencies
- support scope or fee discussions
- improve future planning

Time data should **not** be used to:

- measure personal value
- reward overwork
- justify poor scoping

---

## 8. Completion and Progress

Logging time does **not** imply:

- task completion
- deliverable progress
- project success

Progress is measured through deliverables, not hours consumed.

---

## 9. Change and Corrections

Time logs:

- may be edited to correct mistakes
- should preserve audit history where required

Accuracy matters more than speed.

---

## 10. Rules

!!! quote "Operating Rules for Time Logs"
    1. Time logs must be linked to a deliverable (directly or via task).
    2. Time logs record actual time, not planned time.
    3. Time does not define completion.
    4. Time data is used for learning, not punishment.
    5. Missing time is a data problem, not a moral failure.

---

## 11. Example

!!! success "Example: Time Entry Sequence"
    **Deliverable:** Planning Submission Package  
    **Task:** Update elevations

    **Time log entries:**

    - 1.25h — Adjust elevations per planner feedback
    - 0.5h — Coordination with structural drawings

    Even with 40 hours logged, the deliverable is only complete when submitted.

---

## 12. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Time reveals effort.  
    Deliverables define value.
