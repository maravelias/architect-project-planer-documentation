# Planning & Control Extensions

This section defines supporting concepts that enable coordination, decision-making, and forecasting **without undermining the primacy of deliverables**.

These concepts **inform work** — they do not control it.

---

## 1. Priority

### 1.1 Definition

!!! info "Definition"
    **Priority** expresses the **relative importance of work** at a point in time.

    Priority is a **decision aid**, not a scoring system.

---

### 1.2 Purpose

!!! info "Purpose"
    Priority exists to:

    - guide sequencing of work
    - resolve conflicts when capacity is limited
    - communicate intent and focus

    Priority answers:
    > “What matters more right now?”

---

### 1.3 What Priority Is

!!! abstract "What Priority Is"
    Priority is:

    - relative, not absolute
    - context-dependent
    - intentionally simple
    - changeable

    **Recommended forms:**

    - Ordered lists
    - Small sets (e.g. High / Normal / Low)

---

### 1.4 What Priority Is Not

!!! warning "What Priority Is Not"
    Priority is **not**:

    - a numerical ranking
    - a deadline substitute
    - a guarantee of delivery
    - a measure of effort or value

    If priority becomes algorithmic,  
    judgment has been replaced by automation.

---

### 1.5 Relationship to Core Concepts

- **Projects** may express priority relative to each other
- **Deliverables** are the primary carriers of priority
- **Tasks** inherit priority from their deliverable
- **Capacity** constrains how priority is acted upon

---

### 1.6 Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Priority guides attention.  
    It does not compel output.

---

## 2. Status & Progress

### 2.1 Definition

!!! info "Definition"
    **Status** describes the **current state** of work.  
    **Progress** reflects **movement toward deliverable completion**.

    They are related, but not interchangeable.

---

### 2.2 Purpose

!!! info "Purpose"
    Status and progress exist to:

    - communicate clarity
    - reduce ambiguity
    - support coordination and reporting

    They describe reality — they do not create it.

---

### 2.3 Status Model (Recommended)

!!! abstract "Status Model (Recommended)"
    Statuses should be **finite and explicit**, for example:

    - Not Started
    - In Progress
    - Blocked
    - Under Review
    - Complete

    **Status applies to:**

    - Deliverables
    - Tasks (independently)

---

### 2.4 Progress Measurement

!!! info "Progress Measurement"
    Progress is:

    - qualitative at the deliverable level
    - derived from deliverable completeness
    - never expressed as time consumed

    **Avoid:**

    - percentage-complete
    - hours-based progress
    - task-count proxies

---

### 2.5 Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Progress is proven by outputs,  
    not by activity.

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibility

### 3.1 Definition

!!! info "Definition"
    **Roles** describe **types of responsibility**.  
    **Responsibility** defines **who is accountable for what**.

    Authority must be explicit to prevent ambiguity.

---

### 3.2 Purpose

!!! info "Purpose"
    Roles and responsibility exist to:

    - clarify ownership
    - prevent gaps and overlaps
    - support delegation without dilution

---

### 3.3 Core Roles (Recommended)

!!! abstract "Core Roles (Recommended)"
    - **Project Owner**  
      Accountable for scope, contract, and client relationship

    - **Deliverable Owner**  
      Accountable for completeness and quality of a deliverable

    - **Contributor**  
      Performs tasks in support of deliverables

    - **Reviewer / Approver**  
      Provides formal or informal sign-off

---

### 3.4 Key Rules

!!! quote "Operating Rules for Roles"
    - Every deliverable has exactly one owner
    - Tasks may have contributors, not owners
    - Responsibility does not require authority over people
    - Accountability cannot be shared without dilution

---

### 3.5 Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Clear ownership enables trust.  
    Ambiguity creates friction.

---

## 4. Estimation

### 4.1 Definition

!!! info "Definition"
    **Estimation** is a **forward-looking approximation of effort** required to complete a deliverable.

    Estimates express **uncertainty**, not commitment.

---

### 4.2 Purpose

!!! info "Purpose"
    Estimation exists to:

    - support planning and sequencing
    - inform fee and scope discussions
    - enable expectation management

    Estimation helps conversation, not control.

---

### 4.3 What Estimation Is

!!! abstract "What Estimation Is"
    Estimation is:

    - primarily at the **deliverable level**
    - approximate by nature
    - revisable as understanding improves
    - informed by historical time data

---

### 4.4 What Estimation Is Not

!!! warning "What Estimation Is Not"
    Estimation is **not**:

    - a promise
    - a task-level mandate
    - a performance benchmark
    - a substitute for scope definition

---

### 4.5 Relationship to Other Concepts

- **Time Logs** inform future estimates
- **Capacity** constrains scheduling, not estimation
- **Tasks** may be estimated locally but do not define scope
- **Projects** aggregate estimates for contractual context

---

### 4.6 Change and Re-Estimation

!!! info "Change and Re-Estimation"
    Re-estimation is expected when:

    - scope changes
    - assumptions are invalidated
    - new information emerges

    Changing an estimate does not imply failure.

---

### 4.7 Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Estimates inform decisions.  
    Deliverables define commitments.

---

## 5. Closing Principle

!!! quote "Closing Principle"
    These extensions exist to **support judgment**,  
    not to replace it.

    **When in conflict:**

    1. Deliverables outrank metrics
    2. Clarity outranks precision
    3. Sustainability outranks optimization
