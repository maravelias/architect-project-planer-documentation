# Phase

---

## 1. Definition

A **Phase** is a **professional or regulatory grouping of work** within a project.

Phases organize deliverables according to:
- industry standards
- contractual agreements
- approval milestones

A phase provides **context and sequence**, not execution detail.

---

## 2. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose of Phases"
    Phases exist to:

    - align work with professional practice
    - support contractual clarity
    - structure approvals and submissions
    - communicate project progression at a high level

Phases make projects understandable.  
They do not make them executable.

---

## 3. What a Phase Is

!!! abstract "Characteristics of a Phase"
    A phase is:

    - a named stage of professional responsibility
    - shared across many projects
    - meaningful to clients and authorities
    - stable over time

**Common examples:**
- Concept Design
- Schematic Design
- Planning / Development Approval
- Detailed Design
- Construction Documentation
- Construction Administration

---

## 4. What a Phase Is Not

!!! warning "A phase is NOT:"
    - a schedule
    - a collection of tasks
    - a time period with fixed duration
    - a progress metric
    - a deliverable

If a phase is treated as something to “complete,” it is being misused.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Concepts

### Project
A project defines which phases are used and in what order.

Not all projects require all phases.

---

### Deliverable
Deliverables belong to exactly one **Phase**.

Deliverables define what is produced in a phase.
Phases do not define deliverables by themselves.

---

### Task
Tasks do not belong directly to phases.

They inherit phase context through their deliverable.

---

### Time Log
Time may be reported by phase for analysis, but time is always recorded against deliverables or tasks.

---

## 6. Sequencing and Overlap

Phases:

- are typically sequential
- may overlap in practice
- may be revisited if scope changes

Phase boundaries do **not** prevent work from continuing, but they clarify responsibility and approval context.

---

## 7. Completion and Progress

Phases themselves are not “completed” in isolation.

!!! success "Completion Criterion"
    A phase is considered effectively complete when:
    
    - **all required deliverables within that phase are complete**

Phase progress is an **aggregate view**, not a state that drives work.

---

## 8. Estimation and Contracts

Phases are often used to:

- allocate fees
- define contractual scope
- structure proposals

**In the system:**

- estimation happens at the deliverable level
- phase totals are derived, not planned independently

---

## 9. Change Management

Changes to a phase:

- usually mean adding, removing, or modifying deliverables
- may indicate a scope change at the project level

Phases themselves change rarely.
Deliverables absorb most variability.

---

## 10. Rules

!!! quote "Operating Rules for Phases"
    1. A project defines its phases explicitly.
    2. Every deliverable belongs to exactly one phase.
    3. Phases must not be used as task containers.
    4. Phases do not have durations by default.
    5. Phase progress is derived from deliverables.

---

## 11. Example

!!! success "Example: Planning / Development Approval"
    **Phase:** Planning / Development Approval

    **Typical deliverables:**

    - Planning Submission Package
    - Authority Response Drawings
    - Revised Planning Set

    The phase is considered complete when all required deliverables are complete, not when a date is reached.

---

## 12. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Phases provide structure.  
    Deliverables provide substance.
