# Project

---

## 1. Definition

A **Project** represents a **contractual engagement** between an architect and a client.

It defines:

- scope of services
- responsibilities
- constraints
- and intended outcomes

A project exists to **produce agreed deliverables** under agreed conditions.

---

## 2. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose of Projects"
    Projects exist to:

    - establish professional responsibility
    - define scope and boundaries
    - provide a container for phases and deliverables
    - align work with contractual agreements

A project is the highest-level unit of accountability in the system.

---

## 3. What a Project Is

!!! abstract "Characteristics of a Project"
    A project is:

    - client-specific
    - time-bounded (by agreement, not scheduling)
    - defined by a scope of services
    - governed by contractual terms

    **Examples include:**

    - Residential New Build for Smith Family
    - Office Fit-Out for Acme Ltd
    - University Laboratory Refurbishment

---

## 4. What a Project Is Not

!!! warning "A project is NOT:"
    - an internal initiative
    - a business goal
    - a portfolio or program
    - a task collection
    - a timesheet container

If work is not tied to a client engagement, it is not a project in this system.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Concepts

### Phase
A project defines:

- which phases apply
- their sequence
- their contractual meaning

Phases do not exist independently of a project.

---

### Deliverable
Deliverables are the **substance** of a project.

A project’s progress and success are measured through deliverable completion.

---

### Task
Tasks exist only to support deliverables within a project.

Projects do not manage tasks directly.

---

### Time Log
Time is recorded within the context of a project, but always against a deliverable or task.

Projects use time for feedback and analysis, not for control.

---

## 6. Scope and Boundaries

A project defines:

- included services
- excluded services
- assumptions
- constraints

Work outside defined scope:

- requires a scope change
- or a new project

Projects protect both client and architect by making boundaries explicit.

---

## 7. Lifecycle

A project typically moves through:

1. Initiation (agreement and setup)
2. Execution (phases and deliverables)
3. Completion (final deliverables and close-out)

The project ends when:

- all agreed deliverables are complete
- contractual obligations are fulfilled

---

## 8. Estimation and Fees

Projects may define:

- total fee
- fee by phase
- billing milestones

In the system:

- estimation occurs at the deliverable level
- project totals are aggregated views

Financial structure does not change conceptual structure.

---

## 9. Change Management

Changes to a project:

- modify scope
- adjust phases or deliverables
- may require contractual variation

Projects change deliberately, not through task-level drift.

---

## 10. Rules

!!! quote "Operating Rules for Projects"
    1. Every deliverable belongs to exactly one project.
    2. A project must have a defined scope of services.
    3. Projects own phases and deliverables, not tasks.
    4. Work outside project scope requires explicit change.
    5. A project is complete only when deliverables are complete.

---

## 11. Example

!!! success "Example: Residential New Build – Smith Family"
    **Project:** Residential New Build – Smith Family

    **Phases:**
    - Concept Design
    - Planning Approval
    - Detailed Design
    - Construction Documentation

    **Deliverables include:**
    - Concept Design Drawing Set
    - Planning Submission Package
    - Construction Issue Drawings

    The project is complete when all agreed deliverables are complete.

---

## 12. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Projects define responsibility.  
    Deliverables define success.
