# Weekly Capacity

---

## 1. Definition

**Weekly Capacity** represents the **maximum sustainable amount of work time** an individual or team can reasonably contribute in a week.

It is a **constraint**, not a target.

Weekly capacity describes **availability**, not commitment.

---

## 2. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose of Weekly Capacity"
    Weekly capacity exists to:

    - prevent over-allocation of people
    - support realistic short-term planning
    - make trade-offs visible
    - protect sustainable working practices

Capacity limits work.  
It does not demand work.

---

## 3. What Weekly Capacity Is

!!! abstract "Characteristics of Weekly Capacity"
    Weekly capacity is:

    - expressed in time units (e.g. hours per week)
    - specific to a person or role
    - adjustable over time
    - independent of projects and deliverables

**Examples:**

- 40h/week — full-time architect
- 32h/week — part-time team member
- 20h/week — external consultant availability

---

## 4. What Weekly Capacity Is Not

!!! warning "Weekly capacity is NOT:"
    - a productivity measure
    - a performance expectation
    - a billing target
    - a promise of output
    - a utilization goal

If capacity is treated as something to “fill,”  
it is being misused.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Concepts

### Person / Role
Weekly capacity belongs to a **person** (or role, if abstracted).

It exists independently of:

- projects
- phases
- deliverables

---

### Task
Tasks may be **scheduled** with awareness of capacity.

Capacity helps answer:

!!! quote "The Capacity Question"
    “Can this person reasonably take this task now?”

Capacity does **not** define:

- task importance
- task priority
- task success

---

### Deliverable
Deliverables may draw on capacity indirectly through tasks.

Deliverables are **not constrained to a single week**.
Capacity only influences sequencing, not scope.

---

### Time Log
Time logs record **actual time spent**.

Capacity represents **potential availability**.

Comparing the two enables:

- reflection
- adjustment
- learning

It does not trigger enforcement.

---

## 6. Planning Horizon

Weekly capacity is intended for:

- near-term planning (1–3 weeks)
- workload balancing
- identifying overload risks early

It is **not** intended for:

- long-term forecasting
- fee justification
- contractual planning

---

## 7. Variability and Adjustment

Weekly capacity may vary due to:

- leave
- public holidays
- illness
- training
- non-project commitments

Capacity should be:

- explicitly adjustable
- transparent
- easy to revise

Changing capacity is normal and expected.

---

## 8. Use in Scheduling

Capacity may be used to:

- visualize availability
- flag over-commitment
- support rescheduling conversations

Capacity must **never** be used to:

- force work into a week
- justify overtime
- measure commitment

---

## 9. Aggregation

Weekly capacity may be:

- viewed individually
- aggregated by team
- summarized at a high level

Aggregated capacity is:

- approximate
- directional
- non-binding

Precision at scale is an illusion.

---

## 10. Rules

!!! quote "Operating Rules for Weekly Capacity"
    1. Weekly capacity is a limit, not a goal.
    2. Capacity belongs to people, not projects.
    3. Capacity does not determine value or performance.
    4. Capacity informs planning; it does not drive it.
    5. Capacity must be adjustable without penalty.

---

## 11. Example

!!! success "Example: Resource Availability"
    **Person:** Senior Architect  
    **Weekly Capacity:** 40h

    **Week context:**

    - 8h annual leave
    - Effective capacity: 32h

    Tasks may be scheduled with this in mind,
    but deliverables remain unchanged.

---

## 12. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Capacity protects people.  
    Deliverables protect outcomes.
