# Task

---

## 1. Definition

A **Task** is a **discrete unit of internal work** performed to advance a deliverable.

Tasks exist to support execution.  
They are not outcomes and do not define success.

---

## 2. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose of Tasks"
    Tasks exist to:

    - break a deliverable into manageable work
    - distribute effort across people or time
    - support coordination and progress tracking
    - provide a place to record time and notes

Tasks make work **doable**, not **valuable**.

---

## 3. What a Task Is

!!! info "Characteristics of a Task"
    A task is:

    - scoped to a specific action
    - limited in duration
    - understandable by the person performing it
    - clearly connected to a single deliverable

**Examples include:**

- Update ground floor plan
- Coordinate elevations with structure
- Prepare drawing list
- Incorporate planning comments

---

## 4. What a Task Is Not

!!! warning "A task is NOT:"
    - a deliverable
    - an ongoing responsibility (e.g. “Project management”)
    - a phase
    - a goal or intention
    - a container for unrelated work

If a task has no clear link to a deliverable, it does not belong in the system.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Concepts

### Deliverable
Every task belongs to exactly one **Deliverable**.

Tasks only exist in the context of a deliverable.
They have no independent meaning.

---

### Phase
Tasks inherit their phase **through the deliverable**.

Tasks are not directly assigned to phases.

---

### Project
Tasks belong to a project **indirectly**, through their deliverable.

Projects do not manage tasks — deliverables do.

---

### Time Log
**Time Logs** are usually recorded against tasks.

This allows time to be captured without turning time into the planning driver.

---

## 6. Task Lifecycle

A task typically moves through the following states:

- Planned
- In Progress
- Blocked
- Complete

Task completion indicates:
- the action is finished

It does **not** indicate that the deliverable is complete.

---

## 7. Granularity

!!! abstract "Granularity Guideline"
    Tasks should be:

    - small enough to complete in days, not weeks
    - large enough to avoid micro-management

    **Rule of thumb:**
    If a task cannot be meaningfully described in one sentence, it is too large.

---

## 8. Estimation

Tasks may be estimated for:

- short-term planning
- individual workload balancing

**However:**

- task estimates do not replace deliverable estimates
- task overruns do not automatically change deliverable scope

Deliverables absorb task variability.

---

## 9. Responsibility

Tasks may have:

- one assigned performer
- or be unassigned until scheduled

Tasks do not have owners in the contractual sense.
Accountability remains with the deliverable owner.

---

## 10. Change and Evolution

Tasks are allowed to change freely.

It is expected that:

- tasks will be added, removed, or redefined
- task lists evolve as understanding improves

Changing tasks does **not** imply a change in deliverable scope.

---

## 11. Rules

!!! quote "Operating Rules for Tasks"
    1. A task must belong to exactly one deliverable.
    2. Tasks must describe actions, not outcomes.
    3. Tasks may change without formal approval.
    4. Completing all tasks does not guarantee deliverable completion.
    5. Tasks must never be used to replace deliverables.

---

## 12. Example

!!! success "Example: Planning Submission Package"
    **Deliverable:** Planning Submission Package

    **Example tasks:**

    - Update site plan
    - Adjust elevations per planner feedback
    - Prepare planning statement draft
    - Internal coordination review

    Even if all tasks are marked complete,  
    the deliverable is only complete once the package is submitted.

---

## 13. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Tasks describe work.  
    Deliverables define success.
