# Deliverable

---

## 1. Definition

A **Deliverable** is a **concrete, reviewable outcome** produced as part of a project.

It represents something that can be:

- reviewed,
- approved,
- submitted,
- or handed over.

A deliverable is the **primary unit of planning, estimation, and control** in the Architect Project Planner.

---

## 2. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose of Deliverables"
    Deliverables exist to:

    - anchor planning in real outcomes
    - connect effort to value
    - provide clear completion criteria
    - support professional and contractual accountability

The system is designed around deliverables, not tasks or hours.

---

## 3. What a Deliverable Is

A deliverable is:

- an identifiable output
- bounded in scope
- meaningful to a client, authority, or internal reviewer
- capable of being *completed*

Examples include:

- Concept Design Drawing Set
- Planning Submission Package
- Detailed Design for Level 03
- Client Presentation Deck
- Authority Response Drawings

---

## 4. What a Deliverable Is Not

A deliverable is **not**:

- a vague activity (e.g. “Design work”)
- a role description
- a recurring administrative task
- a single micro-action
- a timesheet entry

!!! note "Verification Rule"
    If it cannot be reviewed or approved, it is not a deliverable.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Concepts

### Project
Every deliverable belongs to exactly one **Project**.

A project is considered successful through the completion of its deliverables.

---

### Phase
Each deliverable is assigned to one **Phase**.

Phases provide structure and sequencing, but deliverables define the actual outputs.

---

### Task
A deliverable may contain multiple **Tasks**.

Tasks exist to:

- support execution
- distribute work
- track progress

!!! abstract "Deliverables vs Tasks"
    Tasks do **not** define completion — deliverables do.

---

### Time Log
**Time Logs** record actual effort spent working on a deliverable (usually via tasks).

Time is measured **against** deliverables, not instead of them.

---

## 6. Completion Criteria

A deliverable is considered complete when:

- its defined scope is fulfilled
- required reviews or approvals are obtained
- it is ready for submission or handover

!!! tip "Binary State"
    Completion is a **binary state**:

    - incomplete
    - complete

    Partial completion is expressed through progress tracking, not status ambiguity.

---

## 7. Estimation and Planning

Deliverables are:

- estimated as a whole
- planned before execution
- tracked through progress indicators

Estimation answers:
> *How much effort does this deliverable require?*

Tasks answer:
> *How will we execute it?*

---

## 8. Responsibility and Ownership

Each deliverable has:

- a single accountable owner
- potentially multiple contributors

Ownership means responsibility for:

- scope definition
- quality
- completion
- coordination

---

## 9. Change and Versioning

Changes to a deliverable:

- modify its scope
- or create a new deliverable

Versioning tracks evolution, but does not redefine completion.

A deliverable is complete when its **current agreed scope** is complete.

---

## 10. Rules

!!! quote "Operating Rules for Deliverables"
    1. Every deliverable must have a clear definition of done.
    2. Deliverables must be reviewable by a third party.
    3. Deliverables are planned before tasks are detailed.
    4. Time is always associated with a deliverable.
    5. If work produces no deliverable, it must be explicitly justified.

## 11. Example

!!! success "Example: Planning Submission Package"
    **Includes:**

    - site plans
    - floor plans
    - sections
    - elevations
    - planning statement

    **Complete when:**

    - package is coordinated
    - internally reviewed
    - formally submitted to authority

    **Tasks might include:**

    - update floor plans
    - coordinate elevations
    - prepare planning statement

## 12. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Deliverables define success.  
    Everything else exists to support them.
