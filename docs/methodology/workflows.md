# Workflows

---

## 1. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose"
    Workflows describe **how work typically moves through the system**.

    They show how projects, phases, deliverables, tasks, priorities, and capacity interact in practice — **without prescribing rigid procedures**.

    Workflows are **patterns**, not rules.

---

## 2. Nature of Workflows

!!! abstract "Nature of Workflows"
    Workflows in this system are:

    - deliverable-centered
    - iterative rather than linear
    - adaptive to change
    - guided by judgment

    No single workflow is mandatory.  
    These describe **common and supported paths**.

---

## 3. Core Workflow: Project Lifecycle

### 3.1 Project Setup

A project begins when:

- a client engagement is confirmed
- scope of services is defined
- initial deliverables are identified
- responsibility is assigned

!!! success "Outputs"
    - Project created
    - Phases defined
    - Initial deliverables established

No tasks are created at this stage.

---

### 3.2 Deliverable Definition

For each phase:

- deliverables are clarified
- completion criteria are defined
- ownership is assigned

!!! quote "Principle"
    Deliverables represent **contractual intent**, not internal convenience.

---

### 3.3 Execution Planning (Lightweight)

Planning focuses on:

- deliverable priority
- near-term sequencing
- capacity awareness

!!! success "Results"
    - Identification of next actions
    - Optional task creation
    - No fixed schedules

Planning is revisited frequently and kept minimal.

---

### 3.4 Task-Level Execution

Tasks are created when useful to:

- break down work
- coordinate contributors
- clarify responsibility

!!! info "Tasks"
    - inherit priority from their deliverable
    - may be added, changed, or removed freely
    - are not required for progress tracking

Work proceeds based on judgment and context.

---

### 3.5 Time Logging (Optional but Recommended)

As work occurs:

- time is logged against tasks or deliverables
- entries describe actual effort
- logging happens after work is performed

!!! info "Time logging supports:"
    - reflection
    - estimation improvement
    - contractual evidence

It does not drive daily decisions.

---

### 3.6 Review and Feedback

Deliverables periodically enter review:

- internal review
- client review
- authority review (if applicable)

!!! success "Outcomes"
    - feedback incorporated
    - deliverable adjusted
    - or deliverable approved

Review cycles are expected and normal.

---

### 3.7 Deliverable Completion

A deliverable is marked complete when:

- defined completion criteria are met
- required approvals are obtained
- responsibility holder confirms completion

!!! tip "Status Change"
    Completion is explicit and meaningful.

---

### 3.8 Phase Transition

Phases advance when:

- their key deliverables are complete
- contractual requirements are satisfied

!!! note "Sequencing"
    Phases may overlap.
    Completion is not strictly sequential.

---

### 3.9 Project Close-Out

A project concludes when:

- all agreed deliverables are complete
- final submissions are issued
- contractual obligations are fulfilled

!!! note "Post-Project Activity"
    Time logs and tasks may continue briefly for administration,
    but the project is considered complete.

---

## 4. Supporting Workflows

### 4.1 Priority Adjustment Workflow

Priority may change due to:

- client direction
- regulatory feedback
- internal discovery
- resource constraints

!!! abstract "Workflow"
    1. Re-evaluate deliverable priority
    2. Adjust near-term focus
    3. Communicate changes
    4. Re-sequence tasks as needed

No re-planning cascade is required.

---

### 4.2 Capacity Awareness Workflow

Capacity is reviewed:

- weekly
- or when overload is suspected

!!! warning "When capacity is exceeded:"
    - trade-offs are discussed
    - scope or sequencing is adjusted
    - expectations are reset

Overtime is not the default solution.

---

### 4.3 Change Workflow

When scope changes:

1. Change is identified
2. Impact on deliverables is assessed
3. New or revised deliverables are defined
4. Estimates are revisited
5. Agreement is confirmed

!!! danger "Risk Alert"
    Unacknowledged change is treated as risk.

---

### 4.4 Issue and Blocker Workflow

When work is blocked:

- the task or deliverable is marked as blocked
- cause is identified
- responsibility for resolution is clear

!!! note "Tone"
    Blocked status prompts conversation, not blame.

---

## 5. Visibility and Communication

!!! info "Focus"
    Workflows emphasize:

    - clarity over completeness
    - shared understanding
    - minimal administrative overhead

!!! success "Communication Channels"
    Status and progress are communicated through:

    - deliverable states
    - qualitative notes
    - review outcomes

Dashboards support awareness, not control.

---

## 6. What Workflows Avoid

!!! warning "Anti-Patterns"
    Workflows deliberately avoid:

    - rigid step sequences
    - mandatory task breakdowns
    - date-driven enforcement
    - activity-based reporting

Flexibility is a feature, not a weakness.

---

## 7. Summary

!!! success "Summary"
    Workflows provide:

    - structure without rigidity
    - guidance without prescription
    - visibility without surveillance

    They ensure the system reflects professional reality,
    not artificial process.

---

## 8. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Support the way work unfolds,  
    not the way software prefers it.
