# Architectural Method

---

## 1. Purpose

The Architectural Method defines **how professional architectural work is structured, progressed, and completed** within this system.

It reflects how architects **actually think and work**, rather than how software traditionally forces work to be represented.

This method prioritizes:

- professional judgment
- deliverable-based outcomes
- contractual clarity
- sustainable practice

---

## 2. Foundational Principles

### 2.1 Deliverables Define Value

!!! abstract "Deliverables Define Value"
    The fundamental unit of value is the **deliverable**, not time, tasks, or activity.

Work is successful only when:

- agreed deliverables are complete
- quality expectations are met
- contractual obligations are fulfilled

Time and effort support deliverables — they do not define success.

---

### 2.2 Projects Establish Responsibility

!!! info "Projects Establish Responsibility"
    All work exists within a **project**, which represents a contractual engagement.

Projects:

- define scope and boundaries
- establish accountability
- determine applicable phases and deliverables

Work outside project scope requires explicit change.

---

### 2.3 Phases Provide Professional Structure

!!! info "Phases Provide Professional Structure"
    Phases reflect **recognized professional stages** of architectural work.

They:

- organize deliverables logically
- support contractual alignment
- do not imply linear execution

Phases are containers, not schedules.

---

### 2.4 Tasks Enable Execution

!!! info "Tasks Enable Execution"
    Tasks are **temporary units of action**.

They:

- support deliverables
- may change frequently
- are not tracked for success

Completing tasks does not equal progress unless a deliverable advances.

---

### 2.5 Time Records Reality

!!! info "Time Records Reality"
    Time is logged to **reflect what actually happened**.

Time data:

- informs future estimation
- supports analysis and billing
- provides evidence, not direction

Time never drives priorities or scope.

---

### 2.6 Capacity Protects Sustainability

!!! warning "Capacity Protects Sustainability"
    Weekly capacity defines **availability limits**, not expectations.

Capacity:

- constrains planning
- reveals overload risks
- protects people from systemic overcommitment

Unused capacity is acceptable. Overuse is a warning.

---

## 3. How Work Progresses

### 3.1 Initiation

Work begins when:

- a project is defined
- scope and deliverables are agreed
- responsibility is assigned

No tasks or time logs exist without a deliverable context.

---

### 3.2 Execution

Execution is characterized by:

- parallel work across phases
- iterative development of deliverables
- shifting priorities as understanding evolves

The system supports **adaptation**, not rigid plans.

---

### 3.3 Review and Completion

Deliverables move through:

- development
- internal review
- external review (where applicable)
- completion

Completion is explicit and binary at the deliverable level.

---

### 3.4 Change

!!! info "Handling Change"
    Change is expected and legitimate.

When change occurs:

- scope is adjusted
- deliverables are modified or added
- estimates are revised

Change is handled deliberately, not absorbed invisibly.

---

## 4. Decision-Making Model

### 4.1 Priority-Led, Not Schedule-Led

Decisions are made based on:

- relative priority
- available capacity
- deliverable dependencies

Deadlines inform urgency but do not replace judgment.

---

### 4.2 Human Judgment First

!!! quote "Human Judgment First"
    The system assumes:

    - professionals make decisions
    - context matters
    - exceptions are normal

    Automation supports visibility, not authority.

---

## 5. Progress and Visibility

Progress is communicated through:

- deliverable status
- qualitative assessment
- milestone completion

Percentages, utilization rates, and hours consumed are avoided as proxies for progress.

---

## 6. Accountability and Ownership

!!! info "Accountability and Ownership"
    Accountability is explicit:

    - every project has an owner
    - every deliverable has exactly one owner
    - tasks may have contributors

Ownership ensures clarity without micromanagement.

---

## 7. Anti-Patterns Explicitly Rejected

!!! warning "Anti-Patterns Explicitly Rejected"
    This method explicitly rejects:

    - time-driven management
    - task completion as success
    - utilization as performance
    - percentage-complete reporting
    - invisible scope creep

These patterns distort professional work and erode trust.

---

## 8. Role of the System

The system exists to:

- reflect reality accurately
- support professional judgment
- make constraints visible
- preserve contractual clarity

The system does **not**:

- optimize human behavior
- enforce productivity
- replace experience

---

## 9. Summary

The Architectural Method ensures that:

- outcomes matter more than activity
- clarity replaces control
- structure supports creativity
- sustainability is non-negotiable

This method is the **ethical and professional foundation** of the system.

---

## 10. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Build for professionals,  
    not for metrics.
