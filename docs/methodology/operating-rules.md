# Operating Rules

---

## 1. Purpose

!!! info "Purpose"
    Operating Rules define the **non-negotiable constraints** under which the system operates.

    They exist to:

    - preserve the integrity of the methodology
    - prevent misuse and metric-driven behavior
    - protect professional judgment
    - maintain contractual and ethical clarity

    These rules apply **at all times**, regardless of project size or tool used.

---

## 2. Rule Categories

!!! abstract "Rule Categories"
    Operating rules are grouped into:

    1. Structural Rules
    2. Ownership & Accountability Rules
    3. Time & Capacity Rules
    4. Planning & Priority Rules
    5. Progress & Reporting Rules
    6. Change & Integrity Rules

---

## 3. Structural Rules (SR)

### 3.1 SR-1: All Work Must Belong to a Project

!!! info "SR-1"
    No task, time log, or deliverable may exist outside a project.

    Work without a project context is undefined and unsupported.

---

### 3.2 SR-2: Deliverables Are Mandatory for Value

!!! info "SR-2"
    Tasks and time logs must ultimately relate to a deliverable.

    If a deliverable cannot be identified, the work must be questioned.

---

### 3.3 SR-3: Phases Organize, They Do Not Schedule

!!! warning "SR-3"
    Phases:

    - may overlap
    - may be revisited
    - do not imply sequence or duration

    Any interpretation of phases as a schedule is invalid.

---

## 4. Ownership & Accountability Rules (OA)

### 4.1 OA-1: Every Deliverable Has One Owner

!!! info "OA-1"
    Each deliverable must have **exactly one accountable owner**.

    Ownership cannot be shared. Contributors may be many.

---

### 4.2 OA-2: Tasks Have Contributors, Not Owners

!!! abstract "OA-2"
    Tasks represent action, not accountability.

    Completion of a task does not imply success unless the deliverable advances.

---

### 4.3 OA-3: Accountability Cannot Be Delegated Away

!!! info "OA-3"
    Responsibility may be supported, but accountability remains with the owner.

---

## 5. Time & Capacity Rules (TC)

### 5.1 TC-1: Time Logs Record Reality Only

!!! info "TC-1"
    Time logs:

    - record actual time spent
    - are entered after work occurs
    - may be corrected for accuracy

    Planned or target time must not be logged.

---

### 5.2 TC-2: Time Does Not Define Progress

!!! warning "TC-2"
    Logged time does not:

    - advance status
    - indicate completion
    - justify continuation

    Time informs analysis, not decisions.

---

### 5.3 TC-3: Capacity Is a Limit, Not a Target

!!! info "TC-3"
    Weekly capacity:

    - constrains allocation
    - signals overload
    - protects sustainability

    Capacity must never be treated as something to be “filled”.

---

## 6. Planning & Priority Rules (PP)

### 6.1 PP-1: Deliverables Drive Planning

!!! info "PP-1"
    Planning decisions are made at the deliverable level first.

    Tasks exist to serve deliverables, not to define work independently.

---

### 6.2 PP-2: Priority Is Relative and Contextual

!!! abstract "PP-2"
    Priority:

    - is comparative, not absolute
    - may change without fault
    - requires human judgment

    Automated priority scoring is prohibited.

---

### 6.3 PP-3: Plans Are Lightweight and Revisable

!!! info "PP-3"
    Plans are:

    - short-horizon
    - assumption-based
    - expected to change

    Rigidity indicates misuse.

---

## 7. Progress & Reporting Rules (PR)

### 7.1 PR-1: Progress Is Demonstrated, Not Calculated

!!! info "PR-1"
    Progress is shown through:

    - completed deliverables
    - achieved review outcomes
    - tangible outputs

    Percentages and utilization rates are invalid proxies.

---

### 7.2 PR-2: Status Must Be Explicit

!!! info "PR-2"
    Statuses must be:

    - clearly defined
    - mutually understood
    - intentionally limited

    Ambiguous status undermines trust.

---

### 7.3 PR-3: Reporting Serves Understanding

!!! info "PR-3"
    Reports exist to:

    - communicate reality
    - support decisions
    - enable learning

    Reports must not be used to control or coerce behavior.

---

## 8. Change & Integrity Rules (CI)

### 8.1 CI-1: Change Must Be Acknowledged

!!! danger "CI-1"
    When scope changes:

    - deliverables are updated
    - estimates are revisited
    - expectations are reset

    Invisible change is treated as risk.

---

### 8.2 CI-2: Data Must Reflect Truth

!!! info "CI-2"
    All records must:

    - represent actual work and decisions
    - avoid cosmetic adjustments
    - preserve auditability where required

    Manipulated data invalidates learning.

---

### 8.3 CI-3: The System Protects People

!!! info "CI-3"
    No rule may be applied in a way that:

    - incentivizes overwork
    - punishes transparency
    - discourages honest reporting

    Sustainability overrides optimization.

---

## 9. Enforcement Philosophy

!!! abstract "Enforcement Philosophy"
    Operating rules are enforced through:

    - system constraints
    - visibility and transparency
    - professional accountability

    They are **not** enforced through:

    - punitive metrics
    - automated penalties
    - micromanagement

---

## 10. Exception Handling

!!! warning "Exception Handling"
    Exceptions are allowed when:

    - explicitly acknowledged
    - contextually justified
    - transparently recorded

    Silent exceptions are system failures.

---

## 11. Summary

!!! success "Summary"
    Operating Rules ensure that:

    - structure supports judgment
    - data reflects reality
    - deliverables remain central
    - people remain protected

    They are the **guardrails** that keep the system professional.

---

## 12. Guiding Principle

!!! quote "Guiding Principle"
    Rules exist to protect intent,  
    not to replace thinking.
