# Project Roadmap

---

## 1. Roadmap Purpose

This roadmap describes the **progressive evolution** of Architect Project Planner from:

- a conceptual model,
- to a documented methodology,
- to practical implementations,
- and finally to a software-ready product definition.

The roadmap is intentionally **documentation-first** and **implementation-agnostic**.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

All roadmap stages follow these principles:

- **Deliverables before tasks**
- **Clarity before automation**
- **Weekly control before daily optimization**
- **Small-practice reality before enterprise scale**
- **Documentation before implementation**

---

## 3. Phase 0 — Foundation (Current)

### Objective
Establish a clear, shared understanding of the problem, vision, and core model.

### Key Deliverables
- [x] Vision document
- [x] Core philosophy & principles
- [x] High-level conceptual model
- [x] AI contributor guidelines (`AGENTS.md`)
- [x] GitHub repository & documentation tooling

!!! success "Outcome"
    A stable conceptual foundation that can support long-term evolution.

---

## 4. Phase 1 — Core Concepts Documentation

### Objective
Define the fundamental building blocks of the system with absolute clarity.

### Key Deliverables
- **Projects**
- **Phases**
- **Deliverables**
- **Tasks**
- **Time Logs**
- **Weekly Capacity**

### Documentation Focus
- Clear definitions
- Boundaries and responsibilities
- Relationships between concepts
- Diagrams (PlantUML via Kroki)

!!! success "Outcome"
    A shared vocabulary that prevents misinterpretation and scope creep.

---

## 5. Phase 2 — Methodology & Workflows

### Objective
Describe how architects actually use the system in practice.

### Key Deliverables
- Typical project lifecycle workflows
- Authority submission workflows
- Weekly planning process
- Time logging and review cycles
- Handling uncertainty and iteration

### Documentation Focus
- Step-by-step workflows
- Realistic scenarios
- Decision points and constraints
- Minimal but expressive diagrams

!!! success "Outcome"
    A usable methodology that can be applied without software.

---

## 6. Phase 3 — Estimation & Capacity Logic

### Objective
Formalize how time, effort, and risk are handled.

### Key Deliverables
- Time estimation principles
- Planned vs actual tracking
- Weekly capacity rules
- Risk buffers and slack logic
- Feedback loops for learning

### Documentation Focus
- Rules, not algorithms
- Rationale behind decisions
- Practical examples
- Avoiding false precision

!!! success "Outcome"
    A defensible, realistic approach to time control.

---

## 7. Phase 4 — Data Model & Technical Specification

### Objective
Translate methodology into a software-ready structure.

### Key Deliverables
- Conceptual data model
- Entity relationships
- State transitions
- Constraints and invariants
- Non-functional requirements

### Documentation Focus
- PlantUML diagrams
- Clear entity definitions
- Separation of logic and implementation
- Developer-friendly clarity

!!! success "Outcome"
    A specification that can be implemented consistently across tools.

---

## 8. Phase 5 — Reference Implementations

### Objective
Demonstrate how the system works in real tools.

### Key Deliverables
- Excel / spreadsheet MVP
- No-code implementation (e.g. Airtable / Notion)
- Sample datasets
- Example dashboards

### Documentation Focus
- Practical setup guides
- Trade-offs and limitations
- What is simplified vs preserved

!!! success "Outcome"
    Proof that the methodology works without heavy software.

---

## 9. Phase 6 — Productization Readiness

### Objective
Prepare the documentation for transition into a real product.

### Key Deliverables
- SaaS architecture concepts
- UI / UX principles
- API-level thinking
- Permission & role models
- Studio-level scaling rules

### Documentation Focus
- Product boundaries
- What not to build
- Progressive complexity

!!! success "Outcome"
    A clear bridge from documentation to software development.

---

## 10. Phase 7 — Long-Term Evolution (Optional)

### Objective
Explore advanced value without compromising simplicity.

### Possible Directions
- Estimation benchmarks
- Risk pattern analysis
- Fee intelligence
- Cross-project insights
- Studio performance indicators

!!! note "Constraint"
    Only pursue features that:
    
    - reinforce control,
    - respect architectural judgment,
    - and avoid bureaucratic overhead.

---

## 11. Roadmap Philosophy

This roadmap is **non-linear**:

- Some phases may overlap
- Later phases may never be fully implemented
- Documentation quality is more important than completion

Progress is measured by **clarity gained**, not features shipped.

---

## 12. Final Note

!!! quote "Final Note"
    Architect Project Planner is not built to scale fast. It is built to **hold up under professional reality**.
    
    That is its competitive advantage.
