# Architect Project Planner — Documentation

**Deliverable-Driven Project & Time Management for Architects**

This repository contains the **full documentation** for *Architect Project Planner*, a deliverable-centric project management methodology and software specification designed specifically for architects and small design studios.

The documentation is built using **MkDocs** and is intended to serve as:
- A **product and investor reference**
- A **technical specification** for developers
- A **methodology and workflow guide** for architects
- A foundation for future **SaaS or no‑code implementations**

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

Architectural work is not task-based — it is **deliverable-based**.

Most project management tools fail architects because they:
- Focus on tasks instead of submissions
- Encourage unrealistic daily scheduling
- Ignore authority and approval complexity
- Do not improve estimation accuracy over time

**Architect Project Planner** addresses this gap by modeling architectural work the way it actually happens:
through **phases, deliverables, approvals, and time feedback loops**.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Deliverables drive planning**, not tasks
- **Weekly capacity planning**, not daily micromanagement
- **Realistic time estimation**, including iteration and coordination
- **Multi-authority submissions** treated as first-class entities
- **Lightweight workflows** with minimal administrative overhead

---

## 🏗️ Conceptual Model

```text
Projects
└── Phases
    └── Deliverables
        └── Tasks
            └── Time Logs
```

This hierarchy forms the backbone of the methodology and all future implementations.
